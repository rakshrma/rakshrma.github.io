<p>I am a biomedical engineer with a keen interest in medical image analysis, and in general, the applications of AI in diagnostics and therapeutics. I continue to learn and research data science architectures, algorithms, and their use-cases in healthcare to address global challenges. My research journey began during my undergraduate and master's dissertations, and I have steadfastly pursued my passion for innovation within the industry.</p>
<p>Over the past three years as a data scientist at Eli Lilly, I've had the privilege of witnessing the company ascend to its position as the most valued pharmaceutical company worldwide. In my role, I contributed by introducing data science capabilities to the Delivery, Devices, and Connected Solutions team. I feel incredibly fortunate to have participated in numerous innovation projects, including collaborations with Purdue.</p>
<p>My industrial journey commenced in 2013 with the development of Android applications for disease diagnosis using a mobile camera. Around 2015, I transitioned to a startup, where I played a pivotal role in optimizing microfluidics-based immunoassay platforms for hormone detection. Drawing significant insights from this experience, I co-founded a surgical robotics startup aimed at assisting surgeons in executing accurate initial punctures for laparoscopy. This phase of my life was truly exceptional, and I embraced the challenges, wearing multiple hats while acquiring diverse skills to engineer marketable solutions.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable growth, there is still much to learn. With the aspiration to evolve as a better researcher, glean insights from pioneers, and contribute to the cutting-edge research in biomedical engineering, I am determined to pursue my graduate studies.</p>
