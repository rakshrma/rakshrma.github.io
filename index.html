<p>
	I am a biomedical engineer who loves being involved in multidisciplinary projects. During my undergrad, I fabricated a pressure sensor embedded contact lens. For master's dissertation, I collaborated with different research groups to synthesize osteoconductive bone cement for faster bone healing. In 2013, I started my industrial experience by developing android applications for disease diagnosis using mobile camera. Around 2015, I moved to a start-up to optimize their microfluidics-based immunoassay platforms for hormone detection from human serum. Learning a great deal from this experience, I co-founded a surgical robotics startup to assist surgeons perform accurate initial puncture for laproscopy. This was an overwhelming experience and I have probably grown a deal with this period. It was truly amazing to don multiple hats and explore various nuances required to solve a technical challenge and establish business alongside.\n 
	Over last 3 years as a data scientist at Eli Lilly, I have had the opportunity to witness Lilly become the most valued pharmaceutical company. I am involved in early research and Phase-1 development stage on the delivery device side of things. I have been involved in multiple projects in collaboration with Purdue University.\n 
	I have always been part of innovation and research. To learn from the pioneers in the field, and to witness most vibrat research ecosystem first-hand, I plan to pursue my graduate studies.</p>
